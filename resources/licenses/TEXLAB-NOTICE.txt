TexLab is distributed as a separate, standalone binary that communicates with
TextEx exclusively via the Language Server Protocol (LSP) over standard
input/output (stdio). It is NOT linked into, compiled with, or otherwise
combined with the TextEx source code.

TextEx (MIT License) and TexLab (GPL-3.0) are separate programs forming an
"aggregate" distribution as defined in GPL-3.0 Section 5. The inclusion of
TexLab in the TextEx installer does not place TextEx under the GPL.

Users may substitute their own TexLab binary via the "texlabPath" setting.
